# Patterns

Recurring structures validated across 2+ independent systems. Each pattern has concrete instances.

## Cross-Domain Patterns

| Pattern | Instances | Underlying Constraint |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| [[Plan Execute Review Cycle]] | OpenFleet, Harness Engineering, wiki pipeline, superpowers | Bounded context + compound error cost |
| [[Context-Aware Tool Loading]] | Skills vs MCP, Playwright CLI vs MCP, NotebookLM | Context window fills → accuracy degrades |
| [[Progressive Distillation]] | Zettelkasten, PARA, wiki maturity, page sections | Signal degrades without explicit distillation |
| [[Deterministic Shell, LLM Core]] | OpenFleet orchestrator, harness rules, wiki post-chain | LLM reasoning is probabilistic |
| [[Gateway-Centric Routing]] | OpenArms gateway, OpenClaw, wiki MCP, OpenFleet orchestrator | N deployments drift without central control |
| [[Scaffold → Foundation → Infrastructure → Features]] | Research Wiki, OpenFleet, AICP, Front-Middleware-Backend | Build lifecycle repeats at every scale |

## Skills Integration Patterns

| Pattern | What It Maps |
|---------|-------------|
| [[Skills + Claude Code]] | How skills extend the Claude Code agent |
| [[Skills + CLI]] | CLI tools paired with SKILL.md files |
| [[Skills + MCP]] | MCP servers as skill infrastructure |
| [[Skills + NotebookLM]] | NotebookLM automation via skills |
| [[Skills + Obsidian]] | Obsidian vault management via skills |
